Makes visitors and caravans enter your map in an orderly fashion. 

You can place down entering-spots on the edge of the map and any caravan or visitor will try to enter the map as close to a spot as possible. You will find these in the Misc-menu.
You can also toggle the spot to be an exit-spot or both enter and exit. 
This will make pawns try to use these spots when exiting the map as well, except for the traveling pawn-group since they will exit the map on the opposite side that they entered.

Works as a good companion-mod for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2813027453]Ask Before Enter[/url]

Supports most trader-types and also visitors from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552]Hospitality[/url]
Also applies to returning player caravans returning to the map.
There are options if you want to disable the use of spots for some of the above pawn-types.

Optionally you can turn on this for raids (friendly and hostile) as well, just dont abuse it too much ;)
